Parsar - Parse and summarize sar logs into a more human-readable and useful format

Reads sar logs from /var/log/sa and outputs:
TIMESTAMP     CPU%   IOWAIT%    MEM USED    LOAD     SWAP USED

Default is to summarize data hourly.  Can use --daily for daily, or --raw for 10 minutes.
You can use --peak to include the highest measurement during the time interval, as well as the average, or --peakonly to show only the highest measurement.

Load average data uses 5 minute LA.
